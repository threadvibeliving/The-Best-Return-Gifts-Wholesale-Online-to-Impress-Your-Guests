 Adding names, custom tags, or heartfelt notes can make even a small gift incredibly special. It’s the personal touch that makes a lasting impression.

### d. Stay Trend-Savvy
 Keep an eye on what’s trending. Gifting a trending **[gift pack](https://threadvibeliving.com/collections/gifting)**, like scented candles or designer bathroom accessories, ensures your guests are pleasantly surprised.
